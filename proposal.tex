\maketitle

The VST (Visual Studio Technology) and AU (Audio Units) plugin ecosystem contributes greatly to the music industry today. 
With the rise of digital audio workstations (DAWs) in the early 2000s, technology has become an integral part of music production and composition \cite{rana2024influence}.
In particular, the electric guitar has long been associated with technological advancements in the industry. 
Engineers first harnessed the power of vacuum tubes to create the earliest electric guitar amplifiers, and later transitioned to transistor-based designs.
